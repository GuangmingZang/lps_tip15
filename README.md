The code and results of the Label Propagation Saliency (LPS) work published in IEEE Trans. on Image Proc. (TIP 2015)

There are versions of the paper, one is the camera-ready paper published in IEEE; another is the author-preferred full version covering a complete experiment report in different datasets (available here or in arXiv).

## Usage

## Results

## Results of other models
We provide some (time-consuming-to-generate or dependencies-heavily-relied) results of other saliency detectors. We use the original software/code provided in the authors' website (but they does not include maps in the datasets the we experiment on). Do **NOT** email me inquiring on the accessibility of certain models' results.

Currently, the following models are provided (maybe updated once in a while).
